# owrb_gmap_report_generator

This r project includes all of the code necessary to generate static html reports on major aquifers throughout the State of Oklahoma by pulling publically available data out of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board AWQMS database. Many of the figures and functions have some interactivity using R Crosstalk. An example html output file for the elk city aquifer is located in the Reports_2022 subfolder. The main code that generates the reports is called report_generator.R and is located in the R files subfolder. Other files are auxillary and used to run this main file. 

This code was created by Zachary Tomlinson for the Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
